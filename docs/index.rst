Welcome to inheritance_explorer's documentation!
================================================

The ``inheritance_explorer`` is an open source python package for inspecting
other packages. In particular, it focuses on class inheritance structures, allowing
you to produce graphs that recursively map out child classes from a given
starting class. There are a number of useful applications: from learning structures
of unfamiliar code bases to identifying duplicate code.
